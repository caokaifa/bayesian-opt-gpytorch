# Ideas
# 1) Run evaluation for pushing task with parameters optimized by bayesian optimization
#       print confirmation info, print metrics, plot metrics, save to figures
# 2) Run eval with two baseline parametersn
#       print confirmation info, print metrics, plot metrics, save to figures
# * pushing task: which environment with which obstacle setup
# Note: print out an expected time to run before starting
